# Inspiration
Presented with the challenge of allowing customers to view vehicles that are currently in transfer or require light reconditioning, our focus was on creating the most user friendly interface given CarMax’s pre-existing website. We followed similar page formats and added engaging elements from an in-depth progress bar and watch list, to a page exclusively for vehicles undergoing reconditioning.

# What it does
Our project is about giving CarMax customers the advantage of looking at vehicles while they are being reconditioned. It can provide the customers more options in addition to the cars that are ready to be sold, and plan early to buy a vehicle. Customers also become a part of its journey by joining the watchlist where they will be updated on the car’s progress.

Customers also have the opportunity to reserve a car while it is being reconditioned by clicking on the ‘RESERVE’ button. This button would take the user to another webpage where they can input their credentials and reserve the vehicle for a small fee.

# How we built it


# Challenges we ran into
The first challenge we ran into was not fully understanding the challenge which made it difficult for us to come up with an appropriate solution. Our first approach was to look through the pre-existing CarMax website. We noticed that there was a Coming Soon tab and contacted a CarMax sponsor to understand its function and determine what we wanted to change. 

The second problem was coming up with a name for the link where we would showcase our product. At first, we thought that a good name for it would be Coming Soon. However, after browsing the CarMax website, we noticed that there was already a Coming Soon filter. Afterward, the questions we asked ourselves were: How do we come up with a name that would attract users? What’s a name that clearly differentiates from the Coming Soon tab?

# What we learned
Creating things from scratch is hard.
